Here I render a broadcast stream into a format that can be express across various medium.

Although this system can be easily expressed as a single transaction on a slew of different
ledgers, it is currently only the potential of a transaction. If you burn to these 
addresses, then it becomes your responsibility to report that small destruction of your
own personal funds to the proper authorities. 

The unspendable command is used to create a special set of prefix rules:

The first character is always D, the prefix always ends with x
The second character is the "speaker" or "voice"
Satoshi Codes are used to represent line position.

To run, just execute ./cast.bash and a list of obviously unspendable addresses will be sent to stdio. 
Other conventions of the system are loosely defined, but DAx represents author, DBx speaker, DCx title, and DDx and DEx are an ipfs representation of the URL:
